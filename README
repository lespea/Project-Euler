Project-Euler


This module is intended to provide solutions to the Project Euler problems
(http://projecteuler.net) using modern perl best practices and object
oriented programming.  For this reason I will be making heavy use of the
Moose module(s) to wrap the solutions into objects.

Eventually I plan on making a GUI front-end (most likely using PL/TKk to make it easy to use and debug.


This will be my first module I upload to CPAN and, sadly, the first time I'll make extensive use of tests so I have a lot of ground to cover in order to make this happen.
