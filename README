NAME
    Project::Euler - Solutions for <http://projecteuler.net>

VERSION
    version 0.20

SYNOPSIS
        use Project::Euler::Problem::P001;
        my $problem1 = Project::Euler::Problem::P001->new;

        $problem1->solve;
        print $problem1->status;

DESCRIPTION
    This is the base class which will eventually be responsible for
    displaying the interface to interact with the solutions implemented so
    far.

    For now, you will have to manually import the problem_solutions and
    solve them manually.

LIBRARIES
    These libraries are used by the problem solutions:

    1   Project::Euler::Lib::Utils

    2   Project::Euler::Lib::Types

PROBLEMS
    These problems are fully implemented so far (extending the base class
    Project::Euler::Problem::Base)

    1   Project::Euler::Problem::P001

    2   Project::Euler::Problem::P002

    3   Project::Euler::Problem::P003

    4   Project::Euler::Problem::P004

    5   Project::Euler::Problem::P005
