Project::Euler - Solutions for L<< http://projecteuler.net >>

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.1.5

use version 0.77; our $VERSION = qv("v0.1.5");


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Project::Euler;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class which will eventually be responsible for displaying the
interface to interact with the solutions implemented so far.

For now, you will have to manually import the problem_solutions and solve them manually.

    use Project::Euler::Problem::P001;
    my $problem1 = Project::Euler::Problem::P001->new;

    $problem1->solve;
    print $problem1->status;

While not the most elegant solution, it will have to do for now.

=head1 PROBLEMS

These problems are fully implemented so far:
